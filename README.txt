Optimization and Learning 2019 Final Project
Folder: OL2019

To utilize code, add the entire folder to your path. Then, run install.m in MATLAB in the hctsa-package folder; 
this will initialize file paths for your machine.

Then, run the codes (1) finalOL_dataExtract.m and (2) finalOL_optimization.m. Currently, OL_pyomo.ipynb is not
functional and does not give an adequate solution.

Main Pipeline Codes:

finalOL_dataExtract.m: Main code for data extraction. Imports data from MIT-BIH arrhythmia database 
and processes ECG traces to extract individual beats. Then, processes them into a usable format. 
	Dependencies:
		- WFDB MATLAB package
		- HCTSA package

finalOL_optimization.m: Main code for optimization problem. Takes outputs from finalOL_dataExtract.m
and puts them into a Problem-Based optimization problem. 
	Depenencies:
		- Outputs from finalOL_dataExtract.m (PVCdata.mat)
		- MATLAB R2019a Optimization and Machine Learning Toolbox

OL_pyomo.ipynb: First attempt at trying to code the optimization problem but is currently non-functional. 
Was unsuccessful at having the optimization problem converge. 
	Dependencies:  
		- Outputs from finalOL_dataExtract.m (PVCdata.mat)

Folders:

data: contains the .mat files generated by both finalOL_dataExtract.m and finalOL_optimization.m. Currently
I've removed RF_Model_200trees.mat because it was too large to be committed. All the other generated files 
should be present

figures: contains figures generated by finalOL_optimization.m 

hctsa-master: open source code obtained from https://github.com/benfulcher/hctsa for feature extraction
For a new computer, the install.m script should be run to ensure file paths are correct.

helperFunctions: a list of .m functions called by finalOL_optimization.m

objectiveFunctions: a list of .m objective functions called by finalOL_optimization.m during the
problem-based optimization

WFDB_tools: package obtained from https://physionet.org/physiotools/wfdb.shtml for loading in MIT
database
